                I am a Japanese highschool student living in Santiago, Chile: born in Lima, Peru.  
                Due to my father's occupation I have moved my entire life: Japan, Nepal, Costa Rica, Chile.
                Each country is distict with unique qualities of it's own, the life, the people, geograhic landscapes, culture, etc...  
                I am so gratiful that I am able to see, meet, and experience these countries with my family. 
                At times moving was difficult because I had a predominant skin condition (eczema / atopic-dermatitis) since I was born for 17 years(2020).
                Only recently did it purge, and I wrote about my struggles and how life looked like each painful night against eczema, 
                <a href="https://medium.com/@miki.kimura.minniemouse/fighting-against-eczema-atopic-dermatitis-c530d7c932cc" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                Without my loving and supportive family, I wouldn't have been able to be the person I am today, they mean a lot a lot to me. 
                <br>
                Currently, quarentine gave me a chance to sit, think, and research about something I had never comtemplated about... future careers. My thought process in much brevity --> 
                First and foremost, I wanted to help the natural environment from the surging global warming. Second, I was always interested in whales and the ocean ecosystem.
                Third, I didn't want a sendentary job. Afterdays, I deviated my future plans from business to marine biology, because I hadn't realized how passionate I was about saving marine life.  
                <br>
                That's a little about my life.

                        I enjoy playing basketball a lot, especially the gratification after each shot that you make. I am no means a good basketball player, 
                        however, I think endeavoring on something your passionate about will create improvements. I started playing in middle school.   
                        In freshmen year, I was in lowest team out of 3, Junior Varsity B team. I went to my first JV SAAC Basketball tournament, 
                        which was very challenging and bad for me.
                        However, I continued to preseaver and I was able to recieve the "Most Improved Player in the JV B Girls Basketball" award. On top of that,
                        in sophmore year I got into JV A team, and was selected for SAAC 2020. Unfortunately, due to the situation with COVID-19, it was cancelled. 
                        Yet, I felt great gratification as I thought my ambition to practice showed results of improvement.  
                        Playing basketball with your team, your friends, and even yourself is so much fun and teaches you a lot: communication, teamwork, more...

                            I joined the school Ski Club in freshmen year, as I had never skied or snowboarded in my entire life. 
                            It was a perfect oppurtunity in Chile, with the blinding white snow covering the Andes. 
                            I enjoyed this new experience; adrenaline running through my body, wind blowing into my face, the pain from falling, and more... are all estatic. 
                            I'm still awkward in the slopes, I would love to go back and try improving a bit more.
